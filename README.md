Welcome to PasswordPlus+, I built a comprehensive web application focused on personal security. This application features a password strength tool, password management tool, and a contact form.

First we arrive to the home page:

We then will arrive to the password strength tool, the password strength tool uses a JavaScript function, users can have  real-time feedback instantly, and check the strength of their passwords against a predefined criteria. 

Here we can see successful output message to user when the criteria is met :

Now we then arrice to the password management tool, users can easily store and manage their passwords all in one location. I addressed the challenge of relying solely on local storage by integrating our application with Express and Axios. Passwords are now securely stored on the server, enhancing data protection and accessibility. We can ensure when we inspect the website, the network is handling these requests successfully.

The last feature on this page will be the contact form, for our contact form, I implemented a submission mechanism using JavaScript and Axios. Upon submitting the form, user input is captured and packaged, this data is then sent as a GET request to our backend server. Once received, the server processes the form data and provides a response, confirming successful submission.

Feel free to explore and enjoy the other pages including an interactive fun facts page and another contact form.
